# Form variables

Most integrations need to collect one or more pieces of configuration data that supports the integration, such as API tokens or webhook endpoints.

To support these configurations, describe a set of
`formVariables` that define these configuration properties.

Here's an example:

```json
    "formVariables": [
        {
            "key": "endpointUrl",
            "name": "Webhook endpoint URL",
            "description": "Enter the URL to the webhook endpoint",
            "defaultValue": "https://example.com/inbound_webhook",
            "type": "url"
        },
        {
            "key": "apiToken",
            "name": "API Key",
            "description": "Enter your [API key](https://example.com/api) here",
            "type": "string",
            "isSecret": true
        }
    ],
```

The `formVariables` entry above displays as the following UI in the [LaunchDarkly Integrations page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/default/integrations):

Form variables apply to the entire integration configuration. There are no capability-specific form variables.

The `formVariables[].description` will be used as a field label on the UI. You can use simple markdown to link a word or phrase to an external URL.

Accepted form variable types are `string`, `boolean`, `uri`, `enum`, and `dynamicEnum`. Optionally, you can set `isSecret` or `isOptional` if necessary, or provide guidance with `placeholder` and `defaultValue`. If you provide a `defaultValue`, you must also set `isOptional` to `true` and vice versa.
