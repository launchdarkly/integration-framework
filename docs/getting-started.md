# Getting started

There are several steps to building an integration with LaunchDarkly.

## Prerequisites

Before you connect LaunchDarkly with a third-party service, replicate your integration's desired behavior in an isolated standalone environment separate from LaunchDarkly.

The easiest way to do this is to use [`curl`](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html). Find the API documentation for your third-party service and execute sample commands against the service. When you execute your sample commands, observe the request semantics. This helps streamline your manifest and template definitions.

If you are looking to integrate with a third-party service that you are not directly associated with, please open a [Feature Request](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/issues/new/choose) describing your goal and expectations for the integration before submitting any pull requests.

## Step 1: Fork this repository

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

After you finish building your integration, you can submit a pull request to LaunchDarkly to have it approved and deployed.

To learn more about submitting a pull request, read [Step 8: Submit your integration](#step-8-submit-your-integration).

## Step 2: Create a new directory inside `./integrations`

Create a new directory inside the [integrations](../integrations) directory. Name it after your organization or give it the integration's name, for example, `your-company-name-dot-com`. The directory name must not have any spaces and must use [kebab-casing](https://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase).

Only change files and directories inside your new directory. Our validation process rejects any pull requests with modified content outside of your directory.

## Step 3: Create your integration manifest

Each integration contains a manifest defining basic concepts about your integration and organization. Manifests also instruct LaunchDarkly in how to interact with your integration.

Defining your manifest is the single most important step in contributing your integration to LaunchDarkly's platform. It's important to configure your manifest correctly.

To learn more, read [Integration manifest](manifest.md).

## Step 4: Collect integration configuration data from LaunchDarkly account members

Most integrations need to collect one or more pieces of configuration data that support the integration. For example, your integration may collect API tokens or webhook endpoints.

You can describe a set of `formVariables` that define these configuration properties.

To learn more, read [Form variables](form-variables.md).

## Step 5: Define your integration's capabilities

The next step to define your LaunchDarkly integration is describing its `capabilities`. Your integration's `capabilities` are how it interacts with LaunchDarkly.

To learn more, read [Capabilities](capabilities.md).

## Step 6: Validate your integration

To validate your integration:

1. Run `npm install` to install the validation dependencies.
2. Run `npm test` to run the validation suite.

Use Node.js v16 when running the above `npm` commands.

Additionally, we recommend you install [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#install) with `pre-commit install`. This runs the validation suite before every commit, saving you time if you need to troubleshoot anything.

Some of the capabilities have their own validation tools. To learn more, read [Capabilities](capabilities.md).

## Step 7: Create your user documentation and README

Now that your integration is built and validated, you must provide documentation for users and integration maintainers.

Find LaunchDarkly's user documentation at [docs.launchdarkly.com](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/integrations). You can submit new docs to the [LaunchDarkly-Docs repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/LaunchDarkly-Docs). Submit a pull request to this repository with a new integrations guide. Follow the pattern and language used by existing integration guides.

In addition to user documentation, you must to provide guidance on how to maintain and test your integration. Specify this developer-focused documentation in an integration README (`README.md`) in your integration's directory. The README should also link to the user documentation you provide.

## Step 8: Submit your integration

After you've built your integration, [submit a pull request against this repository](https://github.com/launchdarkly/integration-framework/pull/new/main).

When you submit a pull request, your branch will run through some automated validations and be reviewed by our team. If we're ready to publish your integration, we'll get your permission and publish your integration and documentation live on our site.
