Feature flags give you control over your deployment and rollout. They can also provide context to third-party tools that show you how your application reacts to flag changes. You can integrate these tools with LaunchDarkly using the LaunchDarkly integration framework. For additional background, read [Building your own integrations](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/integrations/building-integrations) in our LaunchDarkly product documentation.

This repository contains LaunchDarkly integrations built by our community. Most of these integrations consume events from LaunchDarkly to provide the external tools with more context.

LaunchDarkly's integration framework lets you build one-way integrations from LaunchDarkly to a third-party service. We support a small subset of actions that let you subscribe to LaunchDarkly events to trigger an action or event in your service. You can think of this capability as a webhook, with the added convenience of not having to write your own service to manage the integration. LaunchDarkly manages the configuration, authentication, and transformation of our events to what your service expects without having to create an intermediary service.
