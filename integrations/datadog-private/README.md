[API documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/?lang=bash#events)

Run `npm run curl datadog-private` in the root repository directory to generate a `curl` command to send data to Datadog.

**Note:** This integration currently lives alongside our standard Datadog integration. This integration should only be enabled for customers who cannot use our standard integration because they have a private Datadog instance (unique host URL).
