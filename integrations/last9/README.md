# Last9 #

Send Launchdarkly events (changes in configuration) to Last9. Integration will unlock:
- Correlating Launchdarkly events with other key KPIs (Key Performing Indicator) of your system to reduce MTTD.
- Create intelligent alert rules by changing alert configuration like threshold etc, according to the type of event received which helps in getting more contextual alerts and reduce alert noise.
- Visualise these events on service dashboards to have an overall view of system activities and health.


# Getting started with the Splunk integration $
